    <p>Being a self taught dev, I had to first figure out everything I'd need to know about web development and then spend 100s of hours <a ref="Myles Buchanans Portfolio" href="portfolio.html">practicing</a> to be great.(which I'm still working on.) I've spent a vast amount of time googling curriculums from different bootcamps and different bachelors degrees in computer science and IT. Here is a list of everything I've either learned or plan to learn. 
        College was never for me and it only took 3 years and a large amount of student loans to decide that I was going to forge my own path to being successful.
